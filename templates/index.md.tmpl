# GitHub Provider

The GitHub provider is used to interact with GitHub resources.

The provider allows you to manage your GitHub organization's members and teams easily. It needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

Terraform 0.13 and later:

{{tffile "examples/example_1.tf"}}

- You **must** add a `required_providers` block to every module that will create resources with this provider. If you do not explicitly require `nexthink-oss/github` in a submodule, your terraform run may [break in hard-to-troubleshoot ways](https://github.com/integrations/terraform-provider-github/issues/876#issuecomment-1303790559).

~> **Note:** When upgrading from `hashicorp/github` to `nexthink-oss/github`, use `terraform state replace-provider`. Otherwise, Terraform will still require the old provider to interact with the state file.

## Authentication

The GitHub provider offers multiple ways to authenticate with GitHub API.

### GitHub CLI

The GitHub provider taps into [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) authentication, where it picks up the token issued by [`gh auth login`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login) command. It is possible to specify the path to the `gh` executable in the `GH_PATH` environment variable, which is useful for when the GitHub Terraform provider can not properly determine its the path to GitHub CLI such as in the cygwin terminal.

### OAuth / Personal Access Token

To authenticate using OAuth tokens, ensure that the `token` argument or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set.

{{tffile "examples/example_3.tf"}}

### GitHub App Installation

To authenticate using a GitHub App installation, ensure that arguments in the `app_auth` block or the `GITHUB_APP_XXX` environment variables are set. The `owner` parameter required in this situation. Leaving out will throw a `403 "Resource not accessible by integration"` error.

Some API operations may not be available when using a GitHub App installation configuration. For more information, refer to the list of [supported endpoints](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-apps).

{{tffile "examples/example_4.tf"}}

~> **Note:** When using environment variables, an empty `app_auth` block is required to allow provider configurations from environment variables to be specified. See: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/142

{{tffile "examples/example_5.tf"}}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported in the `provider` block:

* `token` - (Optional) A GitHub OAuth / Personal Access Token. When not provided or made available via the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable, the provider can only access resources available anonymously.

* `base_url` - (Optional) This is the target GitHub base API endpoint. Providing a value is a requirement when working with GitHub Enterprise. It is optional to provide this value and it can also be sourced from the `GITHUB_BASE_URL` environment variable. The value must end with a slash, for example: `https://terraformtesting-ghe.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/`

* `owner` - (Optional) This is the target GitHub organization or individual user account to manage. For example, `torvalds` and `github` are valid owners. It is optional to provide this value and it can also be sourced from the `GITHUB_OWNER` environment variable. When not provided and a `token` is available, the individual user account owning the `token` will be used. When not provided and no `token` is available, the provider may not function correctly. It is required in case of GitHub App Installation.

* `organization` - (Deprecated) This behaves the same as `owner`, which should be used instead. This value can also be sourced from the `GITHUB_ORGANIZATION` environment variable.

* `app_auth` - (Optional) Configuration block to use GitHub App installation token. When not provided, the provider can only access resources available anonymously.
  * `id` - (Required) This is the ID of the GitHub App. It can sourced from the `GITHUB_APP_ID` environment variable.
  * `installation_id` - (Required) This is the ID of the GitHub App installation. It can sourced from the `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` environment variable.
  * `pem_file` - (Required) This is the contents of the GitHub App private key PEM file. It can also be sourced from the `GITHUB_APP_PEM_FILE` environment variable and may use `\n` instead of actual new lines.

* `rate_limiter` - (Optional) The rate limiting strategy to use. `"modern"` uses go-github-ratelimit for automatic GitHub API rate limit handling. `"legacy"` uses the provider's built-in rate limiting with configurable delays. When using `"modern"`, the `read_delay_ms`, `write_delay_ms`, and `parallel_requests` settings are ignored. Defaults to `"modern"`.

* `write_delay_ms` - (Optional) The number of milliseconds to sleep in between write operations in order to satisfy the GitHub API rate limits. Note that requests to the GraphQL API are implemented as `POST` requests under the hood, so this setting affects those calls as well. Defaults to 1000ms or 1 second if not provided. This setting is ignored when `rate_limiter` is `"modern"`.

* `retry_delay_ms` - (Optional) Amount of time in milliseconds to sleep in between requests to GitHub API after an error response. Defaults to 1000ms or 1 second if not provided, the max_retries must be set to greater than zero.

* `read_delay_ms` - (Optional) The number of milliseconds to sleep in between non-write operations in order to satisfy the GitHub API rate limits. Defaults to 0ms. This setting is ignored when `rate_limiter` is `"modern"`.

* `parallel_requests` - (Optional) Allow the provider to make parallel API calls to GitHub. You may want to set it to `true` when you have a private GitHub Enterprise without strict rate limits. Although, it is not possible to enable this setting on github.com because we enforce the respect of github.com's best practices to avoid hitting abuse rate limits. Defaults to `false` if not set. This setting is ignored when `rate_limiter` is `"modern"`.

* `retryable_errors` - (Optional) "Allow the provider to retry after receiving an error status code, the max_retries should be set for this to work. Defaults to [500, 502, 503, 504]

* `max_retries` - (Optional) Number of times to retry a request after receiving an error status code. Defaults to 3

Note: If you have a PEM file on disk, you can pass it in via `pem_file = file("path/to/file.pem")`.

For backwards compatibility, if more than one of `owner`, `organization`, `GITHUB_OWNER` and `GITHUB_ORGANIZATION` are set, the first in this list takes priority.

1. Setting `organization` in the GitHub provider configuration.
2. Setting the `GITHUB_ORGANIZATION` environment variable.
3. Setting the `GITHUB_OWNER` environment variable.
4. Setting `owner` in the GitHub provider configuration.

~> It is a bug that `GITHUB_OWNER` takes precedence over `owner`, which may be fixed in a future major release. For compatibility with future releases, please set only one of `GITHUB_OWNER` and `owner`.
