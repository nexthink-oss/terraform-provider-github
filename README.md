This project is used to manipulate GitHub resources (repositories, teams, files, etc.) using Terraform. Its Terraform Registry page can be found [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/nexthink-oss/github/).

This is a community-maintained fork of the original [terraform-provider-github](https://github.com/integrations/terraform-provider-github) project, which has seemingly been abandoned by GitHub.

## Requirements

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.13.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.24.x (to build the provider plugin)

## Usage

Detailed documentation for the GitHub provider can be found [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/nexthink-oss/github).

## Contributing

Detailed documentation for contributing to the GitHub provider can be found [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Support

This is a community-supported project, *with no affiliation to GitHub*. Any and all support is provided on a best-effort basis by the maintainers and contributors.
